			<p1>
				After graduating from Rhode Island School
				of Design with a bfa in Graphic Design, I
				worked at the Smithsonian Institution, first
				as a book designer and then as art director for
				publications at the Freer and Sackler Galleries.
				In 2001, I opened my own design practice,
				Carol Beehler Graphic Design. Throughout
				my career, my primary responsibility has been
				the design of books, catalogues, brochures,
				and other exhibition-related printed materials.
				I have continued to work with the same
				category of clients, publishers, and museums
				in my own practice.
				<br />
				<br />
				I think good design is the result of creative
				collaboration between designer and client
				and ultimately should reflect the material
				being presented rather than overpowering it.
				Typography is a key element in design and I
				strive for it to be legible, clean, and elegant.
				<br />
				<br />
				My work has been recognized for design
				excellence more than 100 times and has
				been represented in the following design
				competitions: aiga 50, American Association
				of Museums, American Association of
				University Presses, Art Directors Club of
				Metropolitan Washington, The Art Directors
				Club of New York, and Print Design Annual.
